# Task Dashboard

## Overview
Task Dashboard is a web application built using React and Next.js that allows users to manage tasks effectively. It includes features for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks, along with filtering and pagination.

## Features
- User-friendly interface for task management
- Create, read, update, and delete tasks (CRUD operations)
- Filter tasks by status
- Pagination for managing large sets of tasks
